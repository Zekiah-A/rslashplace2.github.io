It is highly likely that this app has copied the code, or has made a frame (a.k.a webview, which is a browser window embedded inside an app) into the official rplace.live site, in order to either claim that they were the original creators, compromise your personal data, or put ads over the our (the original creator's) site so that they can unfairly profit off of our work. To protect players, we created this page that will show when the rplace.live site detects it is being accessed by a fake app.</p>
		<p>We highly recommend you to uninstall this application, as we can not guarentee this client won't leak important information about your device, serve you with unwanted ads, or collect your personal data.</p>
